This project is devoted to digging into the following topics:

1. ZIG programming
2. FSBL programming
3. muticore ARMv7 (with stm32mp15 as primary target)
4. ARM TrustZone, Secure and Non Secure modes

It should at least boot some OS kernel in non-secure mode, allowing it to communicate with secure mode code.
